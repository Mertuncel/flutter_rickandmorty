# flutter_rickandmorty

 
I have created a responsive Rick and Morty project using the Flutter framework, showcasing my expertise in mobile app development and API integration. This project incorporates various common features, such as UI design, API integration, data persistence, state management, pagination, search functionality, adding items to favorites, and navigation between pages.
